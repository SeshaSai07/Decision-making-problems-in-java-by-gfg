Question:
Given a number a, you have to use if, else if, else conditional statements according to the following:
if number is greater than 100: Print "Big" (without quotes)
else if number is smaller than 10: Print "Small" (without quotes)
else: Print "Number" (without quotes)

Examples:

Input: a = 9
Output: Small
Explanation: Here, the else if condition will work as 9 is smaller than 10.
Input: a = 101
Output: Big
Explanation: 101 is greater than 100, so our if statement works and we print Big.
Input: a = 30
Output: Number
Explanation: 30 is neither greater than 100, nor smaller than 10, so the else statement works here.

Solution:
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public static void solve() {
        // Your Code Here
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        if(a > 100) {
            System.out.println("Big");
        }
        else if (a < 10) {
            System.out.println("Small");
        }
        else {
            System.out.print("Number");
        }
    }
}
