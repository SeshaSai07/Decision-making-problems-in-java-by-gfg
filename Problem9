Question:
Given two numbers a and b. You need to perform basic mathematical operations on them. You will be provided an integer named as operator.

If the operator equals to 1 add a and b, then print the result.
If the operator equals to 2 subtract b from a, then print the result.
If the operator equals to 3 multiply a and b, then print the result.
If the operator equals to any other number, print "Invalid Input"(without quotes).
Note: Do not add a new line at the end.

Examples:

Input: a = 1, b = 2, operator = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: 1 * 2 = 2
Input: a = 2, b = 2, operator = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: 2 - 2 = 0

Solution:
class Solution {
    public void calculate(int a, int b, int operator) {
        // code here
        if(operator == 1){
            System.out.println(a + b);
        }
        else if(operator == 2){
            System.out.println(a - b);
        }
        else if(operator == 3){
            System.out.println(a * b);
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("Invalid Input");
        }
    }
}
