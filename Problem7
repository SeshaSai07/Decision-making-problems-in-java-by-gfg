Question:
Given three numbers a, b, and c. You need to find which is the greatest of them all.

Examples:

Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Clearly, c = 3 is the greatest of (1, 2, 3)
Input: a = 2, b = 2, c = 5
Output: 5
Explanation: Out of (2, 2, 5) 5 is the greatest.

Solution:
//Back-end complete function Template for Java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        // Your code here
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int c = sc.nextInt();
        
        int ans_1 = Math.max(a , b);
        int ans = Math.max(ans_1 , c);
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
